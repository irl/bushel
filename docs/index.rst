Welcome to bushel's documentation!

bushel contains a number of tools for interacting with Tor networks and
Tor-related data. Many design decisions have been taken to specifically benefit
the use-cases of `Tor Metrics <https://metrics.torproject.org/>`_. If you are
looking for a general-purpose library for working with Tor, you may instead
want to look at `stem <https://stem.torproject.org/>`_.
