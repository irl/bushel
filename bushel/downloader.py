    Builds a URL to be used to download a resource.

    To fetch all available server descriptors, for example (please don't do
    this regularly unless using your own local directory cache):

    >>> resource_url(SERVER_DESCRIPTOR)
    '/tor/server/all'

    To fetch a specific server descriptor, you can specify a *fingerprint* or
    a *digest*:

    >>> resource_url(SERVER_DESCRIPTOR,

    .. warning:: If both a digest and fingerprint are specified, strange and
                 unpredictable things may happen.

    To fetch multiple descriptors simultaneously, you can pass a list to the
    fingerprint or digest parameters. In the generated URL, these will be
    sorted such that any ordering of the same fingerprints or digests will
    always produce the same URL (although the sorting algorithm may change
    between releases).

    The :py:class:`DirectoryDownloader` provides an

    operation:

    * Directory Cache ([dir-spec]_ ยง4)
    * Client ([dir-spec]_ ยง5)

    The DirectoryDownloader will not initiate downloads on its own intiative.
    It must be driven to perform downloads through the methods provided.

    .. note:: As a valid consensus is required to implement parts of the
              functionality, the latest consensus is cached internally. This
              cached consensus should not be relied upon by external code. The
              cached consensus will never be served as a response to a request
              for a consensus.

    .. warning:: Switching between directory cache and client modes clears the
                 state that records which servers have been queried for
                 descriptors and should not have further requests made. Ensure
                 that you are not switching modes too often.
